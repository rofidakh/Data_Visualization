# Nutrient-Health Visualization Project

This project focuses on **visualizing the relationship between nutrition and health** using interactive data visualizations.  
We collected and cleaned datasets containing nutritional information and health indicators.  
The project uses **Python libraries** such as Matplotlib and Plotly for creating interactive charts and dashboards.  
Users can explore correlations between different nutrients and health outcomes effectively.  
The dashboard provides insights for researchers and individuals interested in nutrition and wellness.  
This work demonstrates the power of data visualization in understanding complex health and nutrition data.
